I helped build and characterise a low-cost open-source Optical Projection Tomography (OPT) system to image large tissue samples. OPT is an imaging technique used to generate a 3D reconstruction of a cleared sample from a set of 2D projections acquired over a full rotation the sample. We collaborated with AstraZeneca to image a set of adult mouse lungs in a model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
