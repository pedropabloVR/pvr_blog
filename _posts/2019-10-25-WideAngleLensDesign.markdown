Cave photography requires lightweight, wide angle lenses with fast apertures to capture a large field of view with short exposure times in low-light conditions. This project explores the design of a 24 mm, F/1.4 wide angle rectilinear lens to capture large landscapes in massive caves. The lens is modeled after a fixed focal length lens by Canon with these specifications that uses 13 elements and two aspheric surfaces; this model is used as a metric for all performance evaluations. MTF, Distortion, and Relative illumination are used as the primary evaluation metrics, along with packaging and manufacturing constraints. The starting point is a 1976 patent by Canon with these two key specifications that uses 10 elements and one aspheric surface. The importance of vignetting, field weighting, and patience in lens design are discussed as major challenges during the optimization of the lens. The final design has 9 elements and two aspheric surfaces; it was optimized over four different f/stops and four object distances to account for different configurations photographers would use in a cave. The nominal design is manufacturable, however there is room for improvement in future designs to achieve better performance and manufacturability.
