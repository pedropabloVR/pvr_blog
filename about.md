I'm an optical engineer and a final year PhD student at the Laser Analytics Group, University of Cambridge. I enjoy using microscopes and image analysis to answer biological problems.

I've done projects involving lens design, super-resolution microscopy, and quantitative image analysis. To find more about my projects follow this [link.]({{site.baseurl}}/)
