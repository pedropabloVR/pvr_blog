I'm an Optical Engineer interested in developing technologies that can help us study molecular mechanisms of disease.

I'm currently a post-doc in [Professor Madhavi Krishnan's Lab](http://krishnan.chem.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford, working on developing single molecule trapping methods for highly sensitive and precise electrical charge measurements.

I did my PhD (Biotechnology) in the [Laser Analytics Group](https://laser.ceb.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge. My [doctoral work](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.62879) focused on developing optical imaging and analysis methods to study models of disease in samples ranging from the sub-cellular to the organ scale.

My research interests involve **quantitative image analysis**, **optical design**, and **super-resolution microscopy**. To find more about my projects follow [this link.]({{site.baseurl}}/)

I completed my B.S. in Optical Engineering at the University of Rochester in 2016.
