I'm an Optical Engineer and a 4th year PhD student in Biotechnology at the [Laser Analytics Group](https://laser.ceb.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge. I use microscopes and image analysis to answer biological problems.

My research interests involve **quantitative image analysis**, **optical design**, and **super-resolution microscopy**. To find more about my projects follow [this link.]({{site.baseurl}}/)

I completed my B.S. in Optical Engineering at the University of Rochester in 2016.
