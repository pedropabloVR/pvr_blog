I'm an **optical engineer** interested in developing technologies that can help us study molecular mechanisms of disease.
{: style="text-align: justify" }
I'm currently a post-doc in [Professor Madhavi Krishnan's Lab](http://krishnan.chem.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford, working on developing single molecule trapping methods for highly sensitive and precise electrical charge measurements.
{: style="text-align: justify" }
I did my PhD (Biotechnology) in the [Laser Analytics Group](https://laser.ceb.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge from 2016. My [doctoral work](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.62879) focused on developing optical imaging and analysis methods to study models of disease in samples ranging from the sub-cellular to the organ scale. Previously, I completed my B.S. in Optical Engineering at the University of Rochester in 2016, where my research work focused on optical design using CodeV and Zemax.
