I'm an optical engineer and a final year PhD student at the Laser Analytics Group.

I enjoy finding biological problems that can be answered using microscopes and image analysis.

I've done projects which involve designing lenses, analyzing microscopy data, and performing quantitative image analysis. To find more about my projects follow this [here.]({{site.baseurl}}/)
