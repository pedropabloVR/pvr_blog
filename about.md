I'm an optical engineer and a 4th year PhD student in Biotechnology at the [Laser Analytics Group](https://laser.ceb.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge.

I enjoy using microscopes and image analysis to answer biological problems.

I've participated in projects which involve lens design, super-resolution microscopy, and quantitative image analysis. To find more about my projects follow this [link.]({{site.baseurl}}/)

I completed my B.S. in Optical Engineering at the University of Rochester in 2016. You can find my CV [here.]({{site.baseurl}}/files/Vallejo-Ramirez-Pedro-resume-Jan2020.pdf)
